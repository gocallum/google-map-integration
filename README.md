This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Create a key & enable Google Maps related API
1. Go to Google Cloud console https://console.cloud.google.com/ and create new project

The API key created dialog displays your newly created API key. Copy the key to env local
3. Go to 'API & Services', make sure Places API, Places API (New), Geocoding API and Geolocation API is enabled. --other Maps/Places libraries may be needed as well 


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
